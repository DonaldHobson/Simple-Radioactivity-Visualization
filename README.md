# Simple-Radioactivity-Visualization
A simple display of radioactive decay written in python3 with pygame.

The program first asks for a halflife, and then simulates radioactive decay with that halflife. Radioactive atoms are white, non radioactive atoms grey, photons yellow. The red line graph shows the proportion of radioactive atoms left. Horrozontal lines are drawn at 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 ... to show half life. Vertical lines are drawn to mark seconds. A faint grey curve shows the exact exponentiontial. 

There is a version with heat, and a version without. Heat is indicated by vibration and red background.
